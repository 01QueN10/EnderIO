All code (excluding the BuildCraft and other mod APIs, which is covered by their respective licenses) is released into the public domain. 
Do what you want with it, as long as you smile while doing so. While it is not a requirement, it would be nice to know if it is being used and how, so send me hello to **crazypants.mc at gmail.com**.
